    - Added suhosin.stealth which controls if suhosin loads in
      stealth mode when it is not the only zend_extension
      (Required for full compatibility with certain encoders 
       that consider open source untrusted. e.g. ionCube, Zend)
    - Activate suhosin.stealth by default
    - Fixed that Suhosin tries handling functions disabled by
      disable_function. In v0.9.15 it was impossible to disable
      phpinfo() with disable_function.
